module ConditionalSample

  ##
  # This module is suitable as a mixin, using the results of self#to_a
  #
  # It is automatically included in Array, so each of these methods are added
  # to Array when you require 'conditional_sample'
  #
  # For both methods, the 'conditions' array must contain boolean procs
  # using args |arr, elem|
  # arr::  a reference to the current array that has been built up
  #        through the recursion chain.
  # elem:: a reference to the current element being considered.
  #

    ##
    # Return a permutation of 'array' where each element validates to the
    # same index in a 'conditions' array of procs that return Boolean.
    #
    # The output is an array that is a complete permutation of the input array.
    # i.e. output.length == array.length
    #
    # Any elements in the array that are extra to the number of conditions
    # will be assumed valid.
